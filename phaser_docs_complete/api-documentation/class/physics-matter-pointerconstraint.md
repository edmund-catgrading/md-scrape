# PointerConstraint

Phaser.Physics.Matter.PointerConstraint

A Pointer Constraint is a special type of constraint that allows you to click

and drag bodies in a Matter World. It monitors the active Pointers in a Scene,

and when one is pressed down it checks to see if that hit any part of any active

body in the world. If it did, and the body has input enabled, it will begin to

drag it until either released, or you stop it via the `stopDrag` method.

You can adjust the stiffness, length and other properties of the constraint via

the `options` object on creation.

**Description:**

Is this Constraint active or not?

An active constraint will be processed each update. An inactive one will be skipped.

Use this to toggle a Pointer Constraint on and off.

# Public Methods

## destroy

### <instance> destroy()

**Description:**

Destroys this Pointer Constraint instance and all of its references.

> Source: [src/physics/matter-js/PointerConstraint.js#L359](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/physics/matter-js/PointerConstraint.js#L359)  
> Since: 3.0.0

---

## getBody

### <instance> getBody()

**Description:**

Scans all active bodies in the current Matter World to see if any of them

are hit by the Pointer. The *first one* found to hit is set as the active contraint

body.

**Returns:** boolean - `true` if a body was found and set, otherwise `false`.

**Fires:** [Phaser.Physics.Matter.Events#event:DRAG\_START](../event/physics-matter-events.md)

> Source: [src/physics/matter-js/PointerConstraint.js#L194](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/physics/matter-js/PointerConstraint.js#L194)

## hitTestBody

### <instance> hitTestBody(body, position)

**Description:**

Scans the current body to determine if a part of it was clicked on.

If a part is found the body is set as the `constraint.bodyB` property,

as well as the `body` property of this class. The part is also set.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| body | MatterJS.BodyType | No | The Matter Body to check. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| position | [Phaser.Math.Vector2](math-vector2.md) | No | A translated hit test position. |

**Returns:** boolean - `true` if a part of the body was hit, otherwise `false`.

## onDown

### <instance> onDown(pointer)

**Description:**

A Pointer has been pressed down onto the Scene.

If this Constraint doesn't have an active Pointer then a hit test is set to

run against all active bodies in the world during the *next* call to `update`.

If a body is found, it is bound to this constraint and the drag begins.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pointer | [Phaser.Input.Pointer](input-pointer.md) | No | A reference to the Pointer that was pressed. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## onUp

### <instance> onUp(pointer)

**Description:**

A Pointer has been released from the Scene. If it was the one this constraint was using, it's cleared.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pointer | [Phaser.Input.Pointer](input-pointer.md) | No | A reference to the Pointer that was pressed. |

> Since: 3.22.0

---

## stopDrag

### <instance> stopDrag()

**Description:**

Stops the Pointer Constraint from dragging the body any further.

This is called automatically if the Pointer is released while actively

dragging a body. Or, you can call it manually to release a body from a

constraint without having to first release the pointer.

**Description:**

Internal update handler. Called in the Matter BEFORE\_UPDATE step.
