# Timeline

Phaser.Time.Timeline

A Timeline is a way to schedule events to happen at specific times in the future.

You can think of it as an event sequencer for your game, allowing you to schedule the

running of callbacks, events and other actions at specific times in the future.

A Timeline is a Scene level system, meaning you can have as many Timelines as you like, each

belonging to a different Scene. You can also have multiple Timelines running at the same time.

If the Scene is paused, the Timeline will also pause. If the Scene is destroyed, the Timeline

will be automatically destroyed. However, you can control the Timeline directly, pausing,

resuming and stopping it at any time.

Create an instance of a Timeline via the Game Object Factory:

```
Copy
const timeline = this.add.timeline();


```

The Timeline always starts paused. You must call `play` on it to start it running.

You can also pass in a configuration object on creation, or an array of them:

```
Copy
const timeline = this.add.timeline({

    at: 1000,

    run: () => {

        this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo');

    }

});



timeline.play();


```

In this example we sequence a few different events:

```
Copy
const timeline = this.add.timeline([

    {

        at: 1000,

        run: () => { this.logo = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo'); },

        sound: 'TitleMusic'

    },

    {

        at: 2500,

        tween: {

            targets: this.logo,

            y: 600,

            yoyo: true

        },

        sound: 'Explode'

    },

    {

        at: 8000,

        event: 'HURRY_PLAYER',

        target: this.background,

        set: {

            tint: 0xff0000

        }

    }

]);



timeline.play();


```

The Timeline can also be looped with the repeat method:

```
Copy
timeline.repeat().play();


```

There are lots of options available to you via the configuration object. See the

[Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig](../typedef/types-time.md) typedef for more details.

# Public Members

## complete

### complete: boolean

**Description:**

Whether the Timeline is complete (`true`) or not (`false`).

A Timeline is considered complete when all of its events have been run.

If you wish to reset a Timeline after it has completed, you can do so

by calling the `Timeline.reset` method.

You can also use the `Timeline.stop` method to stop a running Timeline,

at any point, without resetting it.

## elapsed

### elapsed: number

**Description:**

The elapsed time counter.

Treat this as read-only.

---

## iteration

### iteration: number

**Description:**

The number of times this Timeline has looped.

This value is incremented each loop if looping is enabled.

---

## loop

### loop: number

**Description:**

The number of times this timeline should loop.

If this value is -1 or any negative number this Timeline will not stop.

> Source: [src/time/Timeline.js#L201](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/time/Timeline.js#L201)  
> Since: 3.80.0

---

## paused

### paused: boolean

**Description:**

Whether the Timeline is running (`true`) or active (`false`).

When paused, the Timeline will not run any of its actions.

By default a Timeline is always paused and should be started by

calling the `Timeline.play` method.

You can use the `Timeline.pause` and `Timeline.resume` methods to control

this value in a chainable way.

## scene

### scene: [Phaser.Scene](scene.md)

**Description:**

The Scene to which this Timeline belongs.

---

## timeScale

### timeScale: number

**Description:**

The Timeline's delta time scale.

Values higher than 1 increase the speed of time, while values smaller than 1 decrease it.

A value of 0 freezes time and is effectively equivalent to pausing the Timeline.

This doesn't affect the delta time scale of any Tweens created by the Timeline.

You will have to set the `timeScale` of each Tween or the Tween Manager if you want them to match.

## getProgress

### <instance> getProgress()

**Description:**

Returns a number between 0 and 1 representing the progress of this Timeline.

A value of 0 means the Timeline has just started, 0.5 means it's half way through,

and 1 means it's complete.

If the Timeline has no events, or all events have been removed, this will return 1.

If the Timeline is paused, this will return the progress value at the time it was paused.

Note that the value returned is based on the number of events that have been completed,

not the 'duration' of the events (as this is unknown to the Timeline).

**Returns:** number - A number between 0 and 1 representing the progress of this Timeline.

## repeat

### <instance> repeat([amount])

**Description:**

Repeats this Timeline.

If the value for `amount` is positive, the Timeline will repeat that many additional times.

For example a value of 1 will actually run this Timeline twice.

Depending on the value given, `false` is 0 and `true`, undefined and negative numbers are infinite.

If this Timeline had any events set to `once` that have already been removed,

they will **not** be repeated each loop.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amount | number | boolean | Yes | -1 | Amount of times to repeat, if `true` or negative it will be infinite. |

---

## reset

### <instance> reset([loop])

**Description:**

Resets this Timeline back to the start.

This will set the elapsed time to zero and set all events to be incomplete.

If the Timeline had any events that were set to `once` that have already

been removed, they will **not** be present again after calling this method.

If the Timeline isn't currently running (i.e. it's paused or complete) then

calling this method resets those states, the same as calling `Timeline.play(true)`.

Any Tweens that were currently running by this Timeline will be stopped.

**Parameters:**

---

## stop

### <instance> stop()

**Description:**

Stops this Timeline.

This will set the `paused` and `complete` properties to `true`.

If you wish to reset the Timeline to the start, then call the `Timeline.reset` method.

**Returns:** [Phaser.Time.Timeline](time-timeline.md) - This Timeline instance.

---

## update

### <instance> update(time, delta)

**Description:**

Called automatically by the Scene update step.

Iterates through all of the Timeline Events and checks to see if they should be run.

If they should be run, then the `TimelineEvent.action` callback is invoked.

If the `TimelineEvent.once` property is `true` then the event is removed from the Timeline.

If the `TimelineEvent.event` property is set then the Timeline emits that event.

If the `TimelineEvent.run` property is set then the Timeline invokes that method.

If the `TimelineEvent.loop` property is set then the Timeline invokes that method when repeated.

If the `TimelineEvent.target` property is set then the Timeline invokes the `run` method on that target.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| time | number | No | The current time. Either a High Resolution Timer value if it comes from Request Animation Frame, or Date.now if using SetTimeout. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| delta | number | No | The delta time in ms since the last frame. This is a smoothed and capped value based on the FPS rate. |
