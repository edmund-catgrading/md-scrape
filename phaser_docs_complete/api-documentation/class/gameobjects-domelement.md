# DOMElement

Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement

DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.

In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game

configuration object:

```
Copy
dom {

  createContainer: true

}


```

You must also have a parent container for Phaser. This is specified by the `parent` property in the

game config.

When these two things are added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned

over the top of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes,

as a result of settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.

If you have not already done so, you have to provide a `parent` in the Game Configuration, or the DOM

Container will fail to be created.

You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing

Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:

```
Copy
this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');


```

The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in

the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,

it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.

You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control

alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.

Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the

cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other

methods available in this class to help construct your elements.

Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its

position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped

at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that

they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have

a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.

They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event

listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas

entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you

change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.

DOM Game Objects can be added to a Phaser Container, however you should only nest them **one level deep**.

Any further down the chain and they will ignore all root container properties.

Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.

Note that you should only have DOM Elements in a Scene with a *single* Camera. If you require multiple cameras,

use parallel scenes to achieve this.

DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert

a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.

Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and

UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top

of your game, and should treat it accordingly.

**Constructor**

`new DOMElement(scene, [x], [y], [element], [style], [innerText])`

**Parameters**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scene | [Phaser.Scene](scene.md) | No |  | The Scene to which this Game Object belongs. A Game Object can only belong to one Scene at a time. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | Yes | 0 | The horizontal position of this DOM Element in the world. |
| y | number | Yes | 0 | The vertical position of this DOM Element in the world. |
| element | Element | string | Yes |  | An existing DOM element, or a string. If a string starting with a # it will do a `getElementById` look-up on the string (minus the hash). Without a hash, it represents the type of element to create, i.e. 'div'. |
| style | string | any | Yes |  | If a string, will be set directly as the elements `style` property value. If a plain object, will be iterated and the values transferred. In both cases the values replacing whatever CSS styles may have been previously set. |
| innerText | string | Yes |  | If given, will be set directly as the elements `innerText` property value, replacing whatever was there before. |

* MULTIPLY
* SCREEN
* ERASE

Canvas has more available depending on browser support.

You can also create your own custom Blend Modes in WebGL.

Blend modes have different effects under Canvas and WebGL, and from browser to browser, depending

on support. Blend Modes also cause a WebGL batch flush should it encounter a new blend mode. For these

reasons try to be careful about the construction of your Scene and the frequency of which blend modes

are used.

---

## scrollFactorX

### scrollFactorX: number

**Description:**

The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.

It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.

A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.

Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when

calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing

the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset

them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

## state

### state: number, string

**Description:**

The current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify this value, although plugins may do so.

Use this property to track the state of a Game Object during its lifetime. For example, it could change from

a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'. The state value should be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), or a string. These are recommended to keep it light and simple, with fast comparisons.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

## transformOnly

### transformOnly: boolean

**Description:**

By default a DOM Element will have its transform, display, opacity, zIndex and blend mode properties

updated when its rendered. If, for some reason, you don't want any of these changed other than the

CSS transform, then set this flag to `true`. When `true` only the CSS Transform is applied and it's

up to you to keep track of and set the other properties as required.

This can be handy if, for example, you've a nested DOM Element and you don't want the opacity to be

picked-up by any of its children.

# Public Methods

## addedToScene

### <instance> addedToScene()

**Description:**

This callback is invoked when this Game Object is added to a Scene.

Can be overriden by custom Game Objects, but be aware of some Game Objects that

will use this, such as Sprites, to add themselves into the Update List.

You can also listen for the `ADDED_TO_SCENE` event from this Game Object.

**Inherits:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#addedToScene](gameobjects-gameobject.md)

---

## addListener

### <instance> addListener(events)

**Description:**

Adds one or more native DOM event listeners onto the underlying Element of this Game Object.

The event is then dispatched via this Game Objects standard event emitter.

For example:

```
Copy
var div = this.add.dom(x, y, element);



div.addListener('click');



div.on('click', handler);


```

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| events | string | No | The DOM event/s to listen for. You can specify multiple events by separating them with spaces. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Overrides:** Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#addListener

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This DOM Element instance.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/domelement/DOMElement.js#L411](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/domelement/DOMElement.js#L411)  
> Since: 3.17.0

## addToDisplayList

### <instance> addToDisplayList([displayList])

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the given Display List.

If no Display List is specified, it will default to the Display List owned by the Scene to which

this Game Object belongs.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely between them.

If this Game Object is already on another Display List when this method is called, it will first

be removed from it, before being added to the new list.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any display list, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| displayList | [Phaser.GameObjects.DisplayList](gameobjects-displaylist.md) | [Phaser.GameObjects.Layer](gameobjects-layer.md) | Yes | The Display List to add to. Defaults to the Scene Display List. |

## addToUpdateList

### <instance> addToUpdateList()

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the Update List belonging to the Scene.

When a Game Object is added to the Update List it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. This method is passed two parameters: `delta` and `time`.

If you wish to run your own logic within `preUpdate` then you should always call

`super.preUpdate(delta, time)` within it, or it may fail to process required operations,

such as Sprite animations.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This Game Object.

## createElement

### <instance> createElement(tagName, [style], [innerText])

**Description:**

Creates a native DOM Element, adds it to the parent DOM Container and then binds it to this Game Object,

so you can control it. The `tagName` should be a string and is passed to `document.createElement`:

```
Copy
this.add.dom().createElement('div');


```

For more details on acceptable tag names see: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement>

You can also pass in a DOMString or style object to set the CSS on the created element, and an optional `innerText`

value as well. Here is an example of a DOMString:

```
Copy
this.add.dom().createElement('div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');


```

And using a style object:

```
Copy
var style = {

  'background-color': 'lime';

  'width': '200px';

  'height': '100px';

  'font': '48px Arial';

};



this.add.dom().createElement('div', style, 'Phaser');


```

If this Game Object already has an Element, it is removed from the DOM entirely first.

Any event listeners you may have previously created will need to be re-created after this call.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tagName | string | No | A string that specifies the type of element to be created. The nodeName of the created element is initialized with the value of tagName. Don't use qualified names (like "html:a") with this method. |

## createFromCache

### <instance> createFromCache(The, [tagName])

**Description:**

Takes a block of html from the HTML Cache, that has previously been preloaded into the game, and then

creates a DOM Element from it. The loaded HTML is set as the `innerHTML` property of the created

element.

Assume the following html is stored in a file called `loginform.html`:

```
Copy
<input type="text" name="nameField" placeholder="Enter your name" style="font-size: 32px">

<input type="button" name="playButton" value="Let's Play" style="font-size: 32px">


```

Which is loaded into your game using the cache key 'login':

```
Copy
this.load.html('login', 'assets/loginform.html');


```

You can create a DOM Element from it using the cache key:

```
Copy
this.add.dom().createFromCache('login');


```

The optional `elementType` argument controls the container that is created, into which the loaded html is inserted.

The default is a plain `div` object, but any valid tagName can be given.

If this Game Object already has an Element, it is removed from the DOM entirely first.

Any event listeners you may have previously created will need to be re-created after this call.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The | string | No |  | key of the html cache entry to use for this DOM Element. |

## getData

### <instance> getData(key)

**Description:**

Retrieves the value for the given key in this Game Objects Data Manager, or undefined if it doesn't exist.

You can also access values via the `values` object. For example, if you had a key called `gold` you can do either:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or access the value directly:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold;


```

You can also pass in an array of keys, in which case an array of values will be returned:

```
Copy
sprite.getData([ 'gold', 'armor', 'health' ]);


```

This approach is useful for destructuring arrays in ES6.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | Array.<string> | No | The key of the value to retrieve, or an array of keys. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** \* - The value belonging to the given key, or an array of values, the order of which will match the input array.

## getDisplayList

### <instance> getDisplayList()

**Description:**

Returns a reference to the underlying display list *array* that contains this Game Object,

which will be either the Scene's Display List or the internal list belonging

to its parent Container, if it has one.

If this Game Object is not on a display list or in a container, it will return `null`.

You should be very careful with this method, and understand that it returns a direct reference to the

internal array used by the Display List. Mutating this array directly can cause all kinds of subtle

and difficult to debug issues in your game.

**Returns:** Array.<[Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md)> - The internal Display List array of Game Objects, or `null`.

**Inherits:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#getDisplayList](gameobjects-gameobject.md)

## getIndexList

### <instance> getIndexList()

**Description:**

Returns an array containing the display list index of either this Game Object, or if it has one,

its parent Container. It then iterates up through all of the parent containers until it hits the

root of the display list (which is index 0 in the returned array).

Used internally by the InputPlugin but also useful if you wish to find out the display depth of

this Game Object and all of its ancestors.

**Returns:** Array.<number> - An array of display list position indexes.

## removeFromDisplayList

### <instance> removeFromDisplayList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Display List it is currently on.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely removed

and added back at a later stage.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any Display List, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This Game Object.

**Fires:** [Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:REMOVED\_FROM\_SCENE](../event/scenes-events.md), [Phaser.GameObjects.Events#event:REMOVED\_FROM\_SCENE](../event/gameobjects-events.md)

## removeFromUpdateList

### <instance> removeFromUpdateList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Scene's Update List.

When a Game Object is on the Update List, it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. Calling this method will remove it from the list, preventing this.

Removing a Game Object from the Update List will stop most internal functions working.

For example, removing a Sprite from the Update List will prevent it from being able to

run animations.

## removeInteractive

### <instance> removeInteractive([resetCursor])

**Description:**

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will queue it

for removal, causing it to no longer be interactive. The removal happens on

the next game step, it is not immediate.

The Interactive Object that was assigned to this Game Object will be destroyed,

removed from the Input Manager and cleared from this Game Object.

If you wish to re-enable this Game Object at a later date you will need to

re-create its InteractiveObject by calling `setInteractive` again.

If you wish to only temporarily stop an object from receiving input then use

`disableInteractive` instead, as that toggles the interactive state, where-as

this erases it completely.

If you wish to resize a hit area, don't remove and then set it as being

interactive. Instead, access the hitarea object directly and resize the shape

being used. I.e.: `sprite.input.hitArea.setSize(width, height)` (assuming the

shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resetCursor | boolean | Yes | false | Should the currently active Input cursor, if any, be reset to the default cursor? |

## setBlendMode

### <instance> setBlendMode(value)

**Description:**

Sets the Blend Mode being used by this Game Object.

This can be a const, such as `Phaser.BlendModes.SCREEN`, or an integer, such as 4 (for Overlay)

Under WebGL only the following Blend Modes are available:

* NORMAL
* ADD
* MULTIPLY
* SCREEN
* ERASE (only works when rendering to a framebuffer, like a Render Texture)

Canvas has more available depending on browser support.

You can also create your own custom Blend Modes in WebGL.

Blend modes have different effects under Canvas and WebGL, and from browser to browser, depending

on support. Blend Modes also cause a WebGL batch flush should it encounter a new blend mode. For these

reasons try to be careful about the construction of your Scene and the frequency in which blend modes

are used.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | string | [Phaser.BlendModes](../namespace/blendmodes.md) | number | No |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

> Since: 3.17.0

---

## setData

### <instance> setData(key, [data])

**Description:**

Allows you to store a key value pair within this Game Objects Data Manager.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled

before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

```
Copy
sprite.setData('name', 'Red Gem Stone');


```

You can also pass in an object of key value pairs as the first argument:

```
Copy
sprite.setData({ name: 'Red Gem Stone', level: 2, owner: 'Link', gold: 50 });


```

To get a value back again you can call `getData`:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or you can access the value directly via the `values` property, where it works like any other variable:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold += 50;


```

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

If the key already exists, a `changedata` event is emitted instead, along an event named after the key.

For example, if you updated an existing key called `PlayerLives` then it would emit the event `changedata-PlayerLives`.

These events will be emitted regardless if you use this method to set the value, or the direct `values` setter.

Please note that the data keys are case-sensitive and must be valid JavaScript Object property strings.

This means the keys `gold` and `Gold` are treated as two unique values within the Data Manager.

**Tags:**

* generic
* genericUse

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | object | No | The key to set the value for. Or an object of key value pairs. If an object the `data` argument is ignored. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | \* | Yes | The value to set for the given key. If an object is provided as the key this argument is ignored. |

## setDepth

### <instance> setDepth(value)

**Description:**

The depth of this Game Object within the Scene.

The depth is also known as the 'z-index' in some environments, and allows you to change the rendering order

of Game Objects, without actually moving their position in the display list.

The default depth is zero. A Game Object with a higher depth

value will always render in front of one with a lower value.

Setting the depth will queue a depth sort event within the Scene.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | The depth of this Game Object. Ensure this value is only ever a number data-type. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## setElement

### <instance> setElement(element, [style], [innerText])

**Description:**

Binds a new DOM Element to this Game Object. If this Game Object already has an Element it is removed from the DOM

entirely first. Any event listeners you may have previously created will need to be re-created on the new element.

The `element` argument you pass to this method can be either a string tagName:

```
Copy
<h1 id="heading">Phaser</h1>



this.add.dom().setElement('heading');


```

Or a reference to an Element instance:

```
Copy
<h1 id="heading">Phaser</h1>



var h1 = document.getElementById('heading');



this.add.dom().setElement(h1);


```

You can also pass in a DOMString or style object to set the CSS on the created element, and an optional `innerText`

value as well. Here is an example of a DOMString:

```
Copy
this.add.dom().setElement(h1, 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');


```

And using a style object:

```
Copy
var style = {

  'background-color': 'lime';

  'width': '200px';

  'height': '100px';

  'font': '48px Arial';

};



this.add.dom().setElement(h1, style, 'Phaser');


```

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| element | string | Element | No | If a string it is passed to `getElementById()`, or it should be a reference to an existing Element. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style | string | any | Yes | Either a DOMString that holds the CSS styles to be applied to the created element, or an object the styles will be ready from. |
| innerText | string | Yes | A DOMString that holds the text that will be set as the innerText of the created element. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This DOM Element instance.

> Since: 3.17.0

---

## setInteractive

### <instance> setInteractive([hitArea], [callback], [dropZone])

**Description:**

Pass this Game Object to the Input Manager to enable it for Input.

Input works by using hit areas, these are nearly always geometric shapes, such as rectangles or circles, that act as the hit area

for the Game Object. However, you can provide your own hit area shape and callback, should you wish to handle some more advanced

input detection.

If no arguments are provided it will try and create a rectangle hit area based on the texture frame the Game Object is using. If

this isn't a texture-bound object, such as a Graphics or BitmapText object, this will fail, and you'll need to provide a specific

shape for it to use.

You can also provide an Input Configuration Object as the only argument to this method.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hitArea | [Phaser.Types.Input.InputConfiguration](../typedef/types-input.md) | any | Yes |  | Either an input configuration object, or a geometric shape that defines the hit area for the Game Object. If not given it will try to create a Rectangle based on the texture frame. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | [Phaser.Types.Input.HitAreaCallback](../typedef/types-input.md) | Yes |  | The callback that determines if the pointer is within the Hit Area shape or not. If you provide a shape you must also provide a callback. |
| dropZone | boolean | Yes | false | Should this Game Object be treated as a drop zone target? |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This GameObject.

## setScrollFactor

### <instance> setScrollFactor(x, [y])

**Description:**

Sets the scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.

It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.

A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.

Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when

calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing

the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset

them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | No |  | The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## setState

### <instance> setState(value)

**Description:**

Sets the current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify the State of a Game Object, although plugins may do so.

For example, a Game Object could change from a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'.

The state value should typically be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), but could also be a string. It is recommended to keep it light and simple.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | string | No | The state of the Game Object. |

## updateDisplayOrigin

### <instance> updateDisplayOrigin()

**Description:**

Updates the Display Origin cached values internally stored on this Game Object.

You don't usually call this directly, but it is exposed for edge-cases where you may.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This Game Object instance.

**Inherits:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Origin#updateDisplayOrigin](../namespace/gameobjects-components-origin.md)

> Source: [src/gameobjects/components/Origin.js#L182](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/components/Origin.js#L182)

## updateSize

### <instance> updateSize()

**Description:**

Internal method that calls `getBoundingClientRect` on the `node` and then sets the bounds width

and height into the `displayWidth` and `displayHeight` properties, and the `clientWidth` and `clientHeight`

values into the `width` and `height` properties respectively.

This is called automatically whenever a new element is created or set.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement](gameobjects-domelement.md) - This DOM Element instance.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/domelement/DOMElement.js#L782](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/domelement/DOMElement.js#L782)  
> Since: 3.17.0

## willRender

### <instance> willRender()

**Description:**

Compares the renderMask with the renderFlags to see if this Game Object will render or not.

DOMElements always return `true` as they need to still set values during the render pass, even if not visible.

**Overrides:** Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#willRender

**Returns:** boolean - `true` if the Game Object should be rendered, otherwise `false`.
