# Zone

Phaser.GameObjects.Zone

A Zone Game Object.

A Zone is a non-rendering rectangular Game Object that has a position and size.

It has no texture and never displays, but does live on the display list and

can be moved, scaled and rotated like any other Game Object.

Its primary use is for creating Drop Zones and Input Hit Areas and it has a couple of helper methods

specifically for this. It is also useful for object overlap checks, or as a base for your own

non-displaying Game Objects.

The default origin is 0.5, the center of the Zone, the same as with Game Objects.

**Constructor**

`new Zone(scene, x, y, [width], [height])`

**Parameters**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scene | [Phaser.Scene](scene.md) | No |  | The Scene to which this Game Object belongs. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | No |  | The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world. |
| y | number | No |  | The vertical position of this Game Object in the world. |
| width | number | Yes | 1 | The width of the Game Object. |
| height | number | Yes | 1 | The height of the Game Object. |

## scale

### scale: number

**Description:**

This is a special setter that allows you to set both the horizontal and vertical scale of this Game Object

to the same value, at the same time. When reading this value the result returned is `(scaleX + scaleY) / 2`.

Use of this property implies you wish the horizontal and vertical scales to be equal to each other. If this

isn't the case, use the `scaleX` or `scaleY` properties instead.

---

## scrollFactorX

### scrollFactorX: number

**Description:**

The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.

It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.

A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.

Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when

calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing

the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset

them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

**Inherits:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Components.ScrollFactor#scrollFactorX](../namespace/gameobjects-components-scrollfactor.md)

## scrollFactorY

### scrollFactorY: number

**Description:**

The vertical scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.

It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.

---

## state

### state: number, string

**Description:**

The current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify this value, although plugins may do so.

Use this property to track the state of a Game Object during its lifetime. For example, it could change from

a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'. The state value should be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), or a string. These are recommended to keep it light and simple, with fast comparisons.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

## addToDisplayList

### <instance> addToDisplayList([displayList])

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the given Display List.

If no Display List is specified, it will default to the Display List owned by the Scene to which

this Game Object belongs.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely between them.

If this Game Object is already on another Display List when this method is called, it will first

be removed from it, before being added to the new list.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any display list, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| displayList | [Phaser.GameObjects.DisplayList](gameobjects-displaylist.md) | [Phaser.GameObjects.Layer](gameobjects-layer.md) | Yes | The Display List to add to. Defaults to the Scene Display List. |

## addToUpdateList

### <instance> addToUpdateList()

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the Update List belonging to the Scene.

When a Game Object is added to the Update List it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. This method is passed two parameters: `delta` and `time`.

If you wish to run your own logic within `preUpdate` then you should always call

`super.preUpdate(delta, time)` within it, or it may fail to process required operations,

such as Sprite animations.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This Game Object.

## destroy

### <instance> destroy([fromScene])

**Description:**

Destroys this Game Object removing it from the Display List and Update List and

severing all ties to parent resources.

Also removes itself from the Input Manager and Physics Manager if previously enabled.

Use this to remove a Game Object from your game if you don't ever plan to use it again.

As long as no reference to it exists within your own code it should become free for

garbage collection by the browser.

If you just want to temporarily disable an object then look at using the

Game Object Pool instead of destroying it, as destroyed objects cannot be resurrected.

**Parameters:**

## getData

### <instance> getData(key)

**Description:**

Retrieves the value for the given key in this Game Objects Data Manager, or undefined if it doesn't exist.

You can also access values via the `values` object. For example, if you had a key called `gold` you can do either:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or access the value directly:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold;


```

You can also pass in an array of keys, in which case an array of values will be returned:

```
Copy
sprite.getData([ 'gold', 'armor', 'health' ]);


```

This approach is useful for destructuring arrays in ES6.

**Parameters:**

## removeFromDisplayList

### <instance> removeFromDisplayList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Display List it is currently on.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely removed

and added back at a later stage.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any Display List, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This Game Object.

**Fires:** [Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:REMOVED\_FROM\_SCENE](../event/scenes-events.md), [Phaser.GameObjects.Events#event:REMOVED\_FROM\_SCENE](../event/gameobjects-events.md)

## removeFromUpdateList

### <instance> removeFromUpdateList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Scene's Update List.

When a Game Object is on the Update List, it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. Calling this method will remove it from the list, preventing this.

Removing a Game Object from the Update List will stop most internal functions working.

For example, removing a Sprite from the Update List will prevent it from being able to

run animations.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This Game Object.

---

## removeInteractive

### <instance> removeInteractive([resetCursor])

**Description:**

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will queue it

for removal, causing it to no longer be interactive. The removal happens on

the next game step, it is not immediate.

The Interactive Object that was assigned to this Game Object will be destroyed,

removed from the Input Manager and cleared from this Game Object.

If you wish to re-enable this Game Object at a later date you will need to

re-create its InteractiveObject by calling `setInteractive` again.

If you wish to only temporarily stop an object from receiving input then use

`disableInteractive` instead, as that toggles the interactive state, where-as

this erases it completely.

If you wish to resize a hit area, don't remove and then set it as being

interactive. Instead, access the hitarea object directly and resize the shape

being used. I.e.: `sprite.input.hitArea.setSize(width, height)` (assuming the

shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resetCursor | boolean | Yes | false | Should the currently active Input cursor, if any, be reset to the default cursor? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This GameObject.

> Since: 3.0.0

---

## setData

### <instance> setData(key, [data])

**Description:**

Allows you to store a key value pair within this Game Objects Data Manager.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled

before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

```
Copy
sprite.setData('name', 'Red Gem Stone');


```

You can also pass in an object of key value pairs as the first argument:

```
Copy
sprite.setData({ name: 'Red Gem Stone', level: 2, owner: 'Link', gold: 50 });


```

To get a value back again you can call `getData`:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or you can access the value directly via the `values` property, where it works like any other variable:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold += 50;


```

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

If the key already exists, a `changedata` event is emitted instead, along an event named after the key.

For example, if you updated an existing key called `PlayerLives` then it would emit the event `changedata-PlayerLives`.

These events will be emitted regardless if you use this method to set the value, or the direct `values` setter.

Please note that the data keys are case-sensitive and must be valid JavaScript Object property strings.

This means the keys `gold` and `Gold` are treated as two unique values within the Data Manager.

**Tags:**

* generic
* genericUse

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | object | No | The key to set the value for. Or an object of key value pairs. If an object the `data` argument is ignored. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | \* | Yes | The value to set for the given key. If an object is provided as the key this argument is ignored. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This GameObject.

---

## setDepth

### <instance> setDepth(value)

**Description:**

The depth of this Game Object within the Scene.

The depth is also known as the 'z-index' in some environments, and allows you to change the rendering order

of Game Objects, without actually moving their position in the display list.

The default depth is zero. A Game Object with a higher depth

value will always render in front of one with a lower value.

Setting the depth will queue a depth sort event within the Scene.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | The depth of this Game Object. Ensure this value is only ever a number data-type. |

## setInteractive

### <instance> setInteractive([hitArea], [callback], [dropZone])

**Description:**

Pass this Game Object to the Input Manager to enable it for Input.

Input works by using hit areas, these are nearly always geometric shapes, such as rectangles or circles, that act as the hit area

for the Game Object. However, you can provide your own hit area shape and callback, should you wish to handle some more advanced

input detection.

If no arguments are provided it will try and create a rectangle hit area based on the texture frame the Game Object is using. If

this isn't a texture-bound object, such as a Graphics or BitmapText object, this will fail, and you'll need to provide a specific

shape for it to use.

You can also provide an Input Configuration Object as the only argument to this method.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hitArea | [Phaser.Types.Input.InputConfiguration](../typedef/types-input.md) | any | Yes |  | Either an input configuration object, or a geometric shape that defines the hit area for the Game Object. If not given it will try to create a Rectangle based on the texture frame. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | [Phaser.Types.Input.HitAreaCallback](../typedef/types-input.md) | Yes |  | The callback that determines if the pointer is within the Hit Area shape or not. If you provide a shape you must also provide a callback. |
| dropZone | boolean | Yes | false | Should this Game Object be treated as a drop zone target? |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This GameObject.

## setScrollFactor

### <instance> setScrollFactor(x, [y])

**Description:**

Sets the scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.

It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.

A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.

Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when

calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing

the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset

them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | No |  | The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y | number | Yes | "x" | The vertical scroll factor of this Game Object. If not set it will use the `x` value. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This Game Object instance.

---

## setState

### <instance> setState(value)

**Description:**

Sets the current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify the State of a Game Object, although plugins may do so.

For example, a Game Object could change from a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'.

The state value should typically be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), but could also be a string. It is recommended to keep it light and simple.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | string | No | The state of the Game Object. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Zone](gameobjects-zone.md) - This GameObject.
