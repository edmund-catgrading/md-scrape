# GameObject

Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject

The base class that all Game Objects extend.

You don't create GameObjects directly and they cannot be added to the display list.

Instead, use them as the base for your own custom classes.

## state

### state: number, string

**Description:**

The current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify this value, although plugins may do so.

Use this property to track the state of a Game Object during its lifetime. For example, it could change from

a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'. The state value should be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), or a string. These are recommended to keep it light and simple, with fast comparisons.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

# Public Methods

## addedToScene

### <instance> addedToScene()

**Description:**

This callback is invoked when this Game Object is added to a Scene.

Can be overriden by custom Game Objects, but be aware of some Game Objects that

will use this, such as Sprites, to add themselves into the Update List.

You can also listen for the `ADDED_TO_SCENE` event from this Game Object.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event | string | symbol | No |  | The event name. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fn | function | No |  | The listener function. |
| context | \* | Yes | "this" | The context to invoke the listener with. |

---

## addToDisplayList

### <instance> addToDisplayList([displayList])

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the given Display List.

If no Display List is specified, it will default to the Display List owned by the Scene to which

this Game Object belongs.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely between them.

If this Game Object is already on another Display List when this method is called, it will first

be removed from it, before being added to the new list.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any display list, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| displayList | [Phaser.GameObjects.DisplayList](gameobjects-displaylist.md) | [Phaser.GameObjects.Layer](gameobjects-layer.md) | Yes | The Display List to add to. Defaults to the Scene Display List. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This Game Object.

**Fires:** [Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:ADDED\_TO\_SCENE](../event/scenes-events.md), [Phaser.GameObjects.Events#event:ADDED\_TO\_SCENE](../event/gameobjects-events.md)

---

## addToUpdateList

### <instance> addToUpdateList()

**Description:**

Adds this Game Object to the Update List belonging to the Scene.

When a Game Object is added to the Update List it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. This method is passed two parameters: `delta` and `time`.

If you wish to run your own logic within `preUpdate` then you should always call

`super.preUpdate(delta, time)` within it, or it may fail to process required operations,

such as Sprite animations.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This Game Object.

> Since: 3.53.0

---

## destroy

### <instance> destroy([fromScene])

**Description:**

Destroys this Game Object removing it from the Display List and Update List and

severing all ties to parent resources.

Also removes itself from the Input Manager and Physics Manager if previously enabled.

Use this to remove a Game Object from your game if you don't ever plan to use it again.

As long as no reference to it exists within your own code it should become free for

garbage collection by the browser.

If you just want to temporarily disable an object then look at using the

Game Object Pool instead of destroying it, as destroyed objects cannot be resurrected.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fromScene | boolean | Yes | false | `True` if this Game Object is being destroyed by the Scene, `false` if not. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Overrides:** Phaser.Events.EventEmitter#destroy

**Fires:** [Phaser.GameObjects.Events#event:DESTROY](../event/gameobjects-events.md)

---

## disableInteractive

### <instance> disableInteractive([resetCursor])

**Description:**

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will disable it.

An object that is disabled for input stops processing or being considered for

input events, but can be turned back on again at any time by simply calling

`setInteractive()` with no arguments provided.

If want to completely remove interaction from this Game Object then use `removeInteractive` instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resetCursor | boolean | Yes | false | Should the currently active Input cursor, if any, be reset to the default cursor? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

## emit

### <instance> emit(event, [args])

**Description:**

Calls each of the listeners registered for a given event.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event | string | symbol | No | The event name. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| args | \* | Yes | Additional arguments that will be passed to the event handler. |

**Returns:** boolean - `true` if the event had listeners, else `false`.

**Inherits:** [Phaser.Events.EventEmitter#emit](events-eventemitter.md)

---

## eventNames

### <instance> eventNames()

**Description:**

Return an array listing the events for which the emitter has registered listeners.

**Returns:** Array.<(string | symbol)> - undefined

> Since: 3.0.0

---

## getData

### <instance> getData(key)

**Description:**

Retrieves the value for the given key in this Game Objects Data Manager, or undefined if it doesn't exist.

You can also access values via the `values` object. For example, if you had a key called `gold` you can do either:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or access the value directly:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold;


```

You can also pass in an array of keys, in which case an array of values will be returned:

```
Copy
sprite.getData([ 'gold', 'armor', 'health' ]);


```

This approach is useful for destructuring arrays in ES6.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | Array.<string> | No | The key of the value to retrieve, or an array of keys. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** \* - The value belonging to the given key, or an array of values, the order of which will match the input array.

---

## getDisplayList

### <instance> getDisplayList()

**Description:**

Returns a reference to the underlying display list *array* that contains this Game Object,

which will be either the Scene's Display List or the internal list belonging

to its parent Container, if it has one.

If this Game Object is not on a display list or in a container, it will return `null`.

You should be very careful with this method, and understand that it returns a direct reference to the

internal array used by the Display List. Mutating this array directly can cause all kinds of subtle

and difficult to debug issues in your game.

**Returns:** Array.<[Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md)> - The internal Display List array of Game Objects, or `null`.

> Since: 3.85.0

---

## getIndexList

### <instance> getIndexList()

**Description:**

Returns an array containing the display list index of either this Game Object, or if it has one,

its parent Container. It then iterates up through all of the parent containers until it hits the

root of the display list (which is index 0 in the returned array).

Used internally by the InputPlugin but also useful if you wish to find out the display depth of

this Game Object and all of its ancestors.

**Returns:** Array.<number> - An array of display list position indexes.

---

## incData

### <instance> incData(key, [amount])

**Description:**

Increase a value for the given key within this Game Objects Data Manager. If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is increased from 0.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled

before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | No |  | The key to change the value for. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amount | number | Yes | 1 | The amount to increase the given key by. Pass a negative value to decrease the key. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

## removeFromDisplayList

### <instance> removeFromDisplayList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Display List it is currently on.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely removed

and added back at a later stage.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any Display List, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly

disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This Game Object.

## removeFromUpdateList

### <instance> removeFromUpdateList()

**Description:**

Removes this Game Object from the Scene's Update List.

When a Game Object is on the Update List, it will have its `preUpdate` method called

every game frame. Calling this method will remove it from the list, preventing this.

Removing a Game Object from the Update List will stop most internal functions working.

For example, removing a Sprite from the Update List will prevent it from being able to

run animations.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This Game Object.

---

## removeInteractive

### <instance> removeInteractive([resetCursor])

**Description:**

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will queue it

for removal, causing it to no longer be interactive. The removal happens on

the next game step, it is not immediate.

The Interactive Object that was assigned to this Game Object will be destroyed,

removed from the Input Manager and cleared from this Game Object.

If you wish to re-enable this Game Object at a later date you will need to

re-create its InteractiveObject by calling `setInteractive` again.

If you wish to only temporarily stop an object from receiving input then use

`disableInteractive` instead, as that toggles the interactive state, where-as

this erases it completely.

If you wish to resize a hit area, don't remove and then set it as being

interactive. Instead, access the hitarea object directly and resize the shape

being used. I.e.: `sprite.input.hitArea.setSize(width, height)` (assuming the

shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resetCursor | boolean | Yes | false | Should the currently active Input cursor, if any, be reset to the default cursor? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

## setActive

### <instance> setActive(value)

**Description:**

Sets the `active` property of this Game Object and returns this Game Object for further chaining.

A Game Object with its `active` property set to `true` will be updated by the Scenes UpdateList.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | No | True if this Game Object should be set as active, false if not. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

## setData

### <instance> setData(key, [data])

**Description:**

Allows you to store a key value pair within this Game Objects Data Manager.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled

before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

```
Copy
sprite.setData('name', 'Red Gem Stone');


```

You can also pass in an object of key value pairs as the first argument:

```
Copy
sprite.setData({ name: 'Red Gem Stone', level: 2, owner: 'Link', gold: 50 });


```

To get a value back again you can call `getData`:

```
Copy
sprite.getData('gold');


```

Or you can access the value directly via the `values` property, where it works like any other variable:

```
Copy
sprite.data.values.gold += 50;


```

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

If the key already exists, a `changedata` event is emitted instead, along an event named after the key.

For example, if you updated an existing key called `PlayerLives` then it would emit the event `changedata-PlayerLives`.

These events will be emitted regardless if you use this method to set the value, or the direct `values` setter.

Please note that the data keys are case-sensitive and must be valid JavaScript Object property strings.

This means the keys `gold` and `Gold` are treated as two unique values within the Data Manager.

**Tags:**

* generic
* genericUse

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | object | No | The key to set the value for. Or an object of key value pairs. If an object the `data` argument is ignored. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | \* | Yes | The value to set for the given key. If an object is provided as the key this argument is ignored. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

## setDataEnabled

### <instance> setDataEnabled()

**Description:**

Adds a Data Manager component to this Game Object.

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L276](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L276)

---

## setInteractive

### <instance> setInteractive([hitArea], [callback], [dropZone])

**Description:**

Pass this Game Object to the Input Manager to enable it for Input.

Input works by using hit areas, these are nearly always geometric shapes, such as rectangles or circles, that act as the hit area

for the Game Object. However, you can provide your own hit area shape and callback, should you wish to handle some more advanced

input detection.

If no arguments are provided it will try and create a rectangle hit area based on the texture frame the Game Object is using. If

this isn't a texture-bound object, such as a Graphics or BitmapText object, this will fail, and you'll need to provide a specific

shape for it to use.

You can also provide an Input Configuration Object as the only argument to this method.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hitArea | [Phaser.Types.Input.InputConfiguration](../typedef/types-input.md) | any | Yes |  | Either an input configuration object, or a geometric shape that defines the hit area for the Game Object. If not given it will try to create a Rectangle based on the texture frame. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | [Phaser.Types.Input.HitAreaCallback](../typedef/types-input.md) | Yes |  | The callback that determines if the pointer is within the Hit Area shape or not. If you provide a shape you must also provide a callback. |
| dropZone | boolean | Yes | false | Should this Game Object be treated as a drop zone target? |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L456](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L456)  
> Since: 3.0.0

## setName

### <instance> setName(value)

**Description:**

Sets the `name` property of this Game Object and returns this Game Object for further chaining.

The `name` property is not populated by Phaser and is presented for your own use.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | string | No | The name to be given to this Game Object. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L234](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L234)  
> Since: 3.0.0

---

## setState

### <instance> setState(value)

**Description:**

Sets the current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify the State of a Game Object, although plugins may do so.

For example, a Game Object could change from a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'.

The state value should typically be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant

in your game code), but could also be a string. It is recommended to keep it light and simple.

If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | string | No | The state of the Game Object. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.

> Source: [src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L252](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L252)  
> Since: 3.16.0

> Since: 3.0.0

---

## toggleData

### <instance> toggleData(key)

**Description:**

Toggle a boolean value for the given key within this Game Objects Data Manager. If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is toggled from false.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled

before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | No | The key to toggle the value for. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](gameobjects-gameobject.md) - This GameObject.
