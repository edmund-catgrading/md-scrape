# Pointer

Phaser.Input.Pointer

A Pointer object encapsulates both mouse and touch input within Phaser.

By default, Phaser will create 2 pointers for your game to use. If you require more, i.e. for a multi-touch

game, then use the `InputPlugin.addPointer` method to do so, rather than instantiating this class directly,

otherwise it won't be managed by the input system.

You can reference the current active pointer via `InputPlugin.activePointer`. You can also use the properties

`InputPlugin.pointer1` through to `pointer10`, for each pointer you have enabled in your game.

The properties of this object are set by the Input Plugin during processing. This object is then sent in all

input related events that the Input Plugin emits, so you can reference properties from it directly in your

callbacks.

**Constructor**

`new Pointer(manager, id)`

## active

### active: boolean

**Description:**

An active Pointer is one that is currently pressed down on the display.

A Mouse is always considered as active.

## angle

### angle: number

**Description:**

The current angle the Pointer is moving, in radians, based on its previous and current position.

The angle is based on the old position facing to the current position.

This property is updated whenever the Pointer moves, regardless of any button states. In other words,

it changes based on movement alone - a button doesn't have to be pressed first.

---

## button

### button: number

**Description:**

A read-only property that indicates which button was pressed, or released, on the pointer

during the most recent event. It is only set during `up` and `down` events.

On Touch devices the value is always 0.

Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device so that if an event's button property

is zero, it may not have been caused by the button that is physically leftâ€“most on the pointing device;

however, it should behave as if the left button was clicked in the standard button layout.

## buttons

### buttons: number

**Description:**

0: No button or un-initialized

1: Left button

2: Right button

4: Wheel button or middle button

8: 4th button (typically the "Browser Back" button)

16: 5th button (typically the "Browser Forward" button)

For a mouse configured for left-handed use, the button actions are reversed.

In this case, the values are read from right to left.

## camera

### camera: [Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera](cameras-scene2d-camera.md)

**Description:**

A Pointer can only ever interact with one camera at once, which will be the top-most camera

in the list should multiple cameras be positioned on-top of each other.

## distance

### distance: number

**Description:**

The distance the Pointer has moved, based on its previous and current position.

This value is smoothed out each frame, according to the `motionFactor` property.

This property is updated whenever the Pointer moves, regardless of any button states. In other words,

it changes based on movement alone - a button doesn't have to be pressed first.

If you need the total distance travelled since the primary buttons was pressed down,

then use the `Pointer.getDistance` method.

## motionFactor

### motionFactor: number

**Description:**

The factor applied to the motion smoothing each frame.

This value is passed to the Smooth Step Interpolation that is used to calculate the velocity,

angle and distance of the Pointer. It's applied every frame, until the midPoint reaches the current

position of the Pointer. 0.2 provides a good average but can be increased if you need a

quicker update and are working in a high performance environment. Never set this value to

zero.

---

## smoothFactor

### smoothFactor: number

**Description:**

The smoothing factor to apply to the Pointer position.

Due to their nature, pointer positions are inherently noisy. While this is fine for lots of games, if you need cleaner positions

then you can set this value to apply an automatic smoothing to the positions as they are recorded.

The default value of zero means 'no smoothing'.

Set to a small value, such as 0.2, to apply an average level of smoothing between positions. You can do this by changing this

value directly, or by setting the `input.smoothFactor` property in the Game Config.

Positions are only smoothed when the pointer moves. If the primary button on this Pointer enters an Up or Down state, then the position

is always precise, and not smoothed.

## getInterpolatedPosition

### <instance> getInterpolatedPosition([steps], [out])

**Description:**

Takes the previous and current Pointer positions and then generates an array of interpolated values between

the two. The array will be populated up to the size of the `steps` argument.

```
Copy
var points = pointer.getInterpolatedPosition(4);



// points[0] = { x: 0, y: 0 }

// points[1] = { x: 2, y: 1 }

// points[2] = { x: 3, y: 2 }

// points[3] = { x: 6, y: 3 }


```

Use this if you need to get smoothed values between the previous and current pointer positions. DOM pointer

events can often fire faster than the main browser loop, and this will help you avoid janky movement

especially if you have an object following a Pointer.

Note that if you provide an output array it will only be populated up to the number of steps provided.

It will not clear any previous data that may have existed beyond the range of the steps count.

Internally it uses the Smooth Step interpolation calculation.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| steps | number | Yes | 10 | The number of interpolation steps to use. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| out | array | Yes |  | An array to store the results in. If not provided a new one will be created. |

**Returns:** array - An array of interpolated values.
