## CONNECTED

**Description:** The Gamepad Connected Event.

This event is dispatched by the Gamepad Plugin when a Gamepad has been connected.

Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.gamepad.once('connected', listener)`.

Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,

this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the

'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads

already connected.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pad | [Phaser.Input.Gamepad](../namespace/input-gamepad.md) | No | A reference to the Gamepad which was connected. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event | Event | No | The native DOM Event that triggered the connection. |

## DISCONNECTED

**Description:** The Gamepad Disconnected Event.

This event is dispatched by the Gamepad Plugin when a Gamepad has been disconnected.

## GAMEPAD\_BUTTON\_DOWN

**Description:** The Gamepad Button Down Event.

This event is dispatched by a Gamepad instance when a button has been pressed on it.

`this.input.gamepad.pad1.on('down', listener)`.

Note that you will not receive any Gamepad button events until the browser considers the Gamepad as being 'connected'.

You can also listen for a DOWN event from the Gamepad Plugin. See the [BUTTON\_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#event:BUTTON\_DOWN} event for details.
