## COLLIDE

**Description:** The Arcade Physics World Collide Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if two bodies collide *and* at least

one of them has their [onCollide]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onCollide} property set to `true`.

It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('collide', listener)`.

Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.

## OVERLAP

**Description:** The Arcade Physics World Overlap Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if two bodies overlap *and* at least

## TILE\_COLLIDE

**Description:** The Arcade Physics Tile Collide Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body collides with a Tile *and*

has its [onCollide]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onCollide} property set to `true`.

It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('tilecollide', listener)`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tile | [Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile](../class/tilemaps-tile.md) | No | The tile the body collided with. |
| body | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | No | The Arcade Physics Body of the Game Object involved in the collision. |

> Since: 3.16.1

## TILE\_OVERLAP

**Description:** The Arcade Physics Tile Overlap Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body overlaps with a Tile *and*

has its [onOverlap]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onOverlap} property set to `true`.

## WORLD\_STEP

**Description:** The Arcade Physics World Step Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance whenever a physics step is run.

It is emitted *after* the bodies and colliders have been updated.

In high framerate settings this can be multiple times per game frame.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('worldstep', listener)`.

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| delta | number | No | The delta time amount of this step, in seconds. |
