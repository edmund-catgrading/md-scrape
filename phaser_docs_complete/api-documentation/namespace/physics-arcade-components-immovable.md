## setImmovable

### <instance> setImmovable([value])

**Description:**

Sets if this Body can be separated during collisions with other bodies.

When a body is immovable it means it won't move at all, not even to separate it from collision

overlap. If you just wish to prevent a body from being knocked around by other bodies, see

the `setPushable` method instead.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | Yes | true | Sets if this body will be separated during collisions with other bodies. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Immovable](physics-arcade-components-immovable.md) - This Game Object.
