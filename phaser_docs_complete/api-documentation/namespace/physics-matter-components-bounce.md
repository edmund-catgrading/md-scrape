## setBounce

### <instance> setBounce(value)

**Description:**

Sets the restitution on the physics object.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | A Number that defines the restitution (elasticity) of the body. The value is always positive and is in the range (0, 1). A value of 0 means collisions may be perfectly inelastic and no bouncing may occur. A value of 0.8 means the body may bounce back with approximately 80% of its kinetic energy. Note that collision response is based on pairs of bodies, and that restitution values are combined with the following formula: `Math.max(bodyA.restitution, bodyB.restitution)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Matter.Components.Bounce](physics-matter-components-bounce.md) - This Game Object instance.
