## CHANGE\_DATA

### CHANGE\_DATA

**Description:**

The Change Data Event.

This event is dispatched by a Data Manager when an item in the data store is changed.

Game Objects with data enabled have an instance of a Data Manager under the `data` property. So, to listen for

a change data event from a Game Object you would use: `sprite.on('changedata', listener)`.

This event is dispatched for all items that change in the Data Manager.

To listen for the change of a specific item, use the `CHANGE_DATA_KEY_EVENT` event.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| parent | any | No | A reference to the object that the Data Manager responsible for this event belongs to. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | No | The unique key of the data item within the Data Manager. |
| value | any | No | The new value of the item in the Data Manager. |
| previousValue | any | No | The previous value of the item in the Data Manager. |

## CHANGE\_DATA\_KEY

### CHANGE\_DATA\_KEY

**Description:**

The Change Data Key Event.

This event is dispatched by a Data Manager when an item in the data store is changed.

Game Objects with data enabled have an instance of a Data Manager under the `data` property. So, to listen for

the change of a specific data item from a Game Object you would use: `sprite.on('changedata-key', listener)`,

where `key` is the unique string key of the data item. For example, if you have a data item stored called `gold`

then you can listen for `sprite.on('changedata-gold')`.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| parent | any | No | A reference to the object that owns the instance of the Data Manager responsible for this event. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | any | No | The item that was updated in the Data Manager. This can be of any data type, i.e. a string, boolean, number, object or instance. |
| previousValue | any | No | The previous item that was updated in the Data Manager. This can be of any data type, i.e. a string, boolean, number, object or instance. |

## REMOVE\_DATA

### REMOVE\_DATA

**Description:**

The Remove Data Event.

This event is dispatched by a Data Manager when an item is removed from it.

Game Objects with data enabled have an instance of a Data Manager under the `data` property. So, to listen for

the removal of a data item on a Game Object you would use: `sprite.on('removedata', listener)`.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| parent | any | No | A reference to the object that owns the instance of the Data Manager responsible for this event. |

## SET\_DATA

### SET\_DATA

**Description:**

The Set Data Event.

This event is dispatched by a Data Manager when a new item is added to the data store.

the addition of a new data item on a Game Object you would use: `sprite.on('setdata', listener)`.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
