## Set

### <static> Set(b1, b2, ov)

**Description:**

Sets all of the local processing values and calculates the velocity exchanges.

Then runs `BlockCheck` and returns the value from it.

This method is called by `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.SeparateY` and should not be

called directly.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b1 | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | No | The first Body to separate. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b2 | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | No | The second Body to separate. |
| ov | number | No | The overlap value. |

**Returns:** number - The BlockCheck result. 0 = not blocked. 1 = Body 1 blocked. 2 = Body 2 blocked.
