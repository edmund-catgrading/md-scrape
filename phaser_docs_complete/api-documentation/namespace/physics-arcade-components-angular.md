# Static functions

## setAngularAcceleration

### <instance> setAngularAcceleration(value)

**Description:**

Sets the angular acceleration of the body.

In Arcade Physics, bodies cannot rotate. They are always axis-aligned.

However, they can have angular motion, which is passed on to the Game Object bound to the body,

causing them to visually rotate, even though the body remains axis-aligned.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | The amount of angular acceleration. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Angular](physics-arcade-components-angular.md) - This Game Object.

## setAngularDrag

### <instance> setAngularDrag(value)

**Description:**

Sets the angular drag of the body. Drag is applied to the current velocity, providing a form of deceleration.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | The amount of drag. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Angular](physics-arcade-components-angular.md) - This Game Object.

## setAngularVelocity

### <instance> setAngularVelocity(value)

**Description:**

Sets the angular velocity of the body.

In Arcade Physics, bodies cannot rotate. They are always axis-aligned.

However, they can have angular motion, which is passed on to the Game Object bound to the body,

causing them to visually rotate, even though the body remains axis-aligned.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | No | The amount of angular velocity. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Angular](physics-arcade-components-angular.md) - This Game Object.
