## COLLIDE

### COLLIDE

**Description:**

The Arcade Physics World Collide Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if two bodies collide *and* at least

one of them has their [onCollide](Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body.md) property set to `true`.

It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('collide', listener)`.

Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gameObject1 | [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](../class/gameobjects-gameobject.md) | No | The first Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of `body1`. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gameObject2 | [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](../class/gameobjects-gameobject.md) | No | The second Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of `body2`. |
| body1 | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody](../class/physics-arcade-staticbody.md) | No | The first Physics Body involved in the collision. |
| body2 | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody](../class/physics-arcade-staticbody.md) | No | The second Physics Body involved in the collision. |

## OVERLAP

### OVERLAP

**Description:**

The Arcade Physics World Overlap Event.

## RESUME

### RESUME

**Description:**

The Arcade Physics World Resume Event.

## TILE\_COLLIDE

### TILE\_COLLIDE

**Description:**

The Arcade Physics Tile Collide Event.

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body collides with a Tile *and*

has its [onCollide](Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body.md) property set to `true`.

It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('tilecollide', listener)`.

Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gameObject | [Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject](../class/gameobjects-gameobject.md) | No | The Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of `body`. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tile | [Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile](../class/tilemaps-tile.md) | No | The tile the body collided with. |
| body | [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body](../class/physics-arcade-body.md) | No | The Arcade Physics Body of the Game Object involved in the collision. |

## WORLD\_STEP

### WORLD\_STEP

**Description:**

This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance whenever a physics step is run.

It is emitted *after* the bodies and colliders have been updated.

In high framerate settings this can be multiple times per game frame.

Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.physics.world.on('worldstep', listener)`.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| delta | number | No | The delta time amount of this step, in seconds. |
