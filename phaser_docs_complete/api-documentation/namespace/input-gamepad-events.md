## CONNECTED

### CONNECTED

**Description:**

The Gamepad Connected Event.

This event is dispatched by the Gamepad Plugin when a Gamepad has been connected.

Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.gamepad.once('connected', listener)`.

Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,

this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the

'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads

already connected.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pad | [Phaser.Input.Gamepad](input-gamepad.md) | No | A reference to the Gamepad which was connected. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event | Event | No | The native DOM Event that triggered the connection. |

## DISCONNECTED

### DISCONNECTED

**Description:**

The Gamepad Disconnected Event.

This event is dispatched by the Gamepad Plugin when a Gamepad has been disconnected.

Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.gamepad.once('disconnected', listener)`.

**Parameters:**
