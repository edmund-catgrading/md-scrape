## disableBody

### <instance> disableBody([disableGameObject], [hideGameObject])

**Description:**

Stops and disables this Game Object's Body.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| disableGameObject | boolean | Yes | false | Also set this Game Object's `active` to false. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hideGameObject | boolean | Yes | false | Also set this Game Object's `visible` to false. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Enable](physics-arcade-components-enable.md) - This Game Object.

## enableBody

### <instance> enableBody([reset], [x], [y], [enableGameObject], [showGameObject])

**Description:**

Enables this Game Object's Body.

If you reset the Body you must also pass `x` and `y`.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reset | boolean | Yes | Also reset the Body and place the Game Object at (x, y). |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | Yes | The horizontal position to place the Game Object, if `reset` is true. |
| y | number | Yes | The horizontal position to place the Game Object, if `reset` is true. |
| enableGameObject | boolean | Yes | Also set this Game Object's `active` to true. |
| showGameObject | boolean | Yes | Also set this Game Object's `visible` to true. |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Enable](physics-arcade-components-enable.md) - This Game Object.

## refreshBody

### <instance> refreshBody()

**Description:**

Syncs the Body's position and size with its parent Game Object.

You don't need to call this for Dynamic Bodies, as it happens automatically.

But for Static bodies it's a useful way of modifying the position of a Static Body

in the Physics World, based on its Game Object.

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Enable](physics-arcade-components-enable.md) - This Game Object.

## setDirectControl

### <instance> setDirectControl([value])

**Description:**

Sets whether this Body should calculate its velocity based on its change in

position every frame. The default, which is to not do this, means that you

make this Body move by setting the velocity directly. However, if you are

trying to move this Body via a Tween, or have it follow a Path, then you

should enable this instead. This will allow it to still collide with other

bodies, something that isn't possible if you're just changing its position directly.

**Parameters:**

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | Yes | true | `true` if the Body calculate velocity based on changes in position, otherwise `false`. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:** [Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Components.Enable](physics-arcade-components-enable.md) - This Game Object.
