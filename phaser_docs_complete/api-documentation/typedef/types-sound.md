| mute | boolean | Yes | false | Boolean indicating whether the sound should be muted or not. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| volume | number | Yes | 1 | A value between 0 (silence) and 1 (full volume). |
| rate | number | Yes | 1 | Defines the speed at which the sound should be played. |
| detune | number | Yes | 0 | Represents detuning of sound in [cents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_%28music%29). |
| seek | number | Yes | 0 | Position of playback for this sound, in seconds. |
| loop | boolean | Yes | false | Whether or not the sound or current sound marker should loop. |
| delay | number | Yes | 0 | Time, in seconds, that should elapse before the sound actually starts its playback. |
| pan | number | Yes | 0 | A value between -1 (full left pan) and 1 (full right pan). 0 means no pan. |
| source | [Phaser.Types.Sound.SpatialSoundConfig](types-sound.md) | Yes | null | An optional config object containing default spatial sound settings. |

## SpatialSoundConfig

### <static> SpatialSoundConfig

Config object containing settings for the source of the spatial sound.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Web_audio_spatialization_basics>

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | Yes | 0 | The horizontal position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y | number | Yes | 0 | The vertical position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| z | number | Yes | 0 | Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| panningModel | 'equalpower' | 'HRTF' | Yes | "'equalpower'" | An enumerated value determining which spatialization algorithm to use to position the audio in 3D space. |
| distanceModel | 'linear' | 'inverse' | 'exponential' | Yes | "'inverse'" |
| orientationX | number | Yes | 0 | The horizontal position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| orientationY | number | Yes | 0 | The vertical position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| orientationZ | number | Yes | -1 | Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system. |
| refDistance | number | Yes | 1 | A double value representing the reference distance for reducing volume as the audio source moves further from the listener. For distances greater than this the volume will be reduced based on `rolloffFactor` and `distanceModel`. |
| maxDistance | number | Yes | 10000 | The maximum distance between the audio source and the listener, after which the volume is not reduced any further. |
| rolloffFactor | number | Yes | 1 | A double value describing how quickly the volume is reduced as the source moves away from the listener. This value is used by all distance models. |
| coneInnerAngle | number | Yes | 360 | The angle, in degrees, of a cone inside of which there will be no volume reduction. |
| coneOuterAngle | number | Yes | 0 | The angle, in degrees, of a cone outside of which the volume will be reduced by a constant value, defined by the `coneOuterGain` property. |
| coneOuterGain | number | Yes | 0 | The amount of volume reduction outside the cone defined by the `coneOuterAngle` attribute. Its default value is 0, meaning that no sound can be heard. A value between 0 and 1. |
| follow | [Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like](types-math.md) | Yes |  | Set this Sound object to automatically track the x/y position of this object. Can be a Phaser Game Object, Vec2 or anything that exposes public x/y properties. |
