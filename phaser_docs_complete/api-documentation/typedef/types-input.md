## EventData

### <static> EventData

A Phaser Input Event Data object.

This object is passed to the registered event listeners and allows you to stop any further propagation.

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cancelled | boolean | Yes | false | The cancelled state of this Event. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stopPropagation | function | No |  | Call this method to stop this event from passing any further down the event chain. |

**Type**: object

**Member of**: Phaser.Types.Input

## HitAreaCallback

### <static> HitAreaCallback

**Type**: function

**Member of**: Phaser.Types.Input

> Source: [src/input/typedefs/HitAreaCallback.js#L1](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/blob/v3.87.0/src/input/typedefs/HitAreaCallback.js#L1)  
> Since: 3.0.0

## InputConfiguration

### <static> InputConfiguration

| name | type | optional | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hitArea | any | Yes |  | The object / shape to use as the Hit Area. If not given it will try to create a Rectangle based on the texture frame. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hitAreaCallback | [Phaser.Types.Input.HitAreaCallback](types-input.md) | Yes |  | The callback that determines if the pointer is within the Hit Area shape or not. |
| draggable | boolean | Yes | false | If `true` the Interactive Object will be set to be draggable and emit drag events. |
| dropZone | boolean | Yes | false | If `true` the Interactive Object will be set to be a drop zone for draggable objects. |
| useHandCursor | boolean | Yes | false | If `true` the Interactive Object will set the `pointer` hand cursor when a pointer is over it. This is a short-cut for setting `cursor: 'pointer'`. |
| cursor | string | Yes |  | The CSS string to be used when the cursor is over this Interactive Object. |
| pixelPerfect | boolean | Yes | false | If `true` the a pixel perfect function will be set for the hit area callback. Only works with image texture based Game Objects, not Render Textures. |
| alphaTolerance | number | Yes | 1 | If `pixelPerfect` is set, this is the alpha tolerance threshold value used in the callback. A value of 255 will match only fully opaque pixels. |

## InputPluginContainer

### <static> InputPluginContainer

| name | type | optional | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | No | The unique name of this plugin in the input plugin cache. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| plugin | function | No | The plugin to be stored. Should be the source object, not instantiated. |
| mapping | string | Yes | If this plugin is to be injected into the Input Plugin, this is the property key map used. |
